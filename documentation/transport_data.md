# Transport data

# Getting input data (transport coefficients)

Transport data can be computed from cross sections with for example:

* [Bolos](https://github.com/aluque/bolos) (Open source two-term Boltzmann
  solver)
* [Bolsig+](http://www.bolsig.laplace.univ-tlse.fr) (Popular two-term Boltzmann
  solver)
* [Magboltz](http://consult.cern.ch/writeup/magboltz/)
* [Particle_swarm](https://gitlab.com/MD-CWI-NL/particle_swarm) (Particle /
  Monte Carlo transport data computation)

Cross section can be obtained from http://lxcat.net. The format of the transport
data used for the streamer models is illustrated in the files in the `transport_data`
folder.
