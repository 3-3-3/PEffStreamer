\section sect_intro Introduction 

Here we describe several examples.

\subsection sect_2d streamer_2d: a 2-dimensional streamer program

The streamer programs discussed here are using configuration files
and set variables accordingly. For each simulation program a configuration
file is available in directory
<a class="el" href="dir_53bba52d758a816fa6b9c79aab7dc56b.html">ConfigureFiles</a>.
After compiling the streamer programs the executables can be run as follows:
	streamer_2d ConfigureFiles/streamer_2d.cfg
	streamer_3d ConfigureFiles/streamer_3d.cfg
	streamer_cyl ConfigureFiles/streamer_cyl.cfg
